# ZenGames
ZenGames is an Android mobile application that was used in a longitudinal study to determine the effect of games with biofeedback on stress response.
The longitudinal study lasted for 21 days. In days 1,7,14 and 21 users performed guided imagery (a relaxation intervention), color word test 1 (pre-game stress test), biofeedback game (or paced breathing for control) and color word test 2(post-game stress test)
On every other day, users played only the game (or did paced breathing for the control group).
The game with biofeedback works by connecting the game with the Zephyr bio harness to obtain breathing and heart rate measurements during the protocol.
Zen games is available on google play store for the users to download. Test and control subjects received two versions of the app, Zen Games BF and Zen Games DB respectively.
